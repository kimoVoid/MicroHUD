# MicroHUD
This is a small mod that adds useful info lines to your HUD, kind of like [masa's MiniHUD](https://github.com/maruohon/minihud).
<br>This mod is made for Forge 1.7.10, specifically for the [Historical SMP](https://discord.gg/4ySWkM2).

## Configuration
The mod can be configured under "Mod Options". You can enable/disable the HUD, enable potion effects HUD and more.
<br>There is also a separate category for configuring which lines to show, and another category for you to define their order.
<br>Additionally, you can also (kind of) change how the HUD looks, although it's very limited at the moment.

## Dependency
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This mod needs a Mixin bootstrap mod to work.

My recommendation is [UniMixins](https://modrinth.com/mod/unimixins). Other Mixin bootstrap mods will work too.
